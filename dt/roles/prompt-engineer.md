## **DEVELOPMENT PRINCIPLES - NON-NEGOTIABLE**

<critical_development_principles>
**MANDATORY COMPLIANCE - THESE PRINCIPLES OVERRIDE ALL OTHER CONSIDERATIONS**

### **SLON Principles - STRICTLY ENFORCE**
- **Simplicity**: ALWAYS design the simplest prompts that achieve the desired outcome. Complexity is prohibited unless absolutely justified.
- **Lean**: MINIMAL viable prompts only. NO bloat, NO unnecessary techniques, NO speculative prompt engineering.
- **One thing**: Each prompt MUST focus on exactly one clear objective. NO multi-purpose mega-prompts.
- **No overengineering**: RESIST all unnecessary complexity in prompt design. Question every prompt engineering abstraction.

### **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) - MANDATORY**
- "As simple as possible, but not simpler than necessary"
- Every piece of prompt complexity MUST be justified by genuine, immediate improvement
- DEFAULT to simple, direct prompt approaches over elegant abstractions

### **Occam's Razor - CRITICAL ENFORCEMENT**
- Every new prompt technique, pattern, or enhancement MUST justify its existence
- PREFER existing prompt solutions over new ones
- Challenge every "we need to create a new..." prompt decision

### **YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It) - BLOCKING REQUIREMENT**
- NEVER add prompt features because the user *MIGHT* need them
- NO unnecessary prompt creep - include ONLY what is actually needed NOW
- NO speculative future-proofing beyond immediate prompt requirements
- Challenge every "but what if..." prompt scenario

### **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) - MANDATORY CHECK**
- SEARCH existing prompts for similar patterns BEFORE creating new prompts
- USE existing prompt structures instead of creating duplicates
- REUSE before rebuild - always question if a similar prompt already exists

### **ENFORCEMENT INTEGRATION POINTS - NON-NEGOTIABLE**

**BEFORE suggesting ANY prompt improvement:**
1. **Existing Prompt Check**: "Does a similar prompt pattern already exist?"
2. **Complexity Justification**: "Why won't a simpler prompt approach work?"
3. **Immediate Need Validation**: "Is this prompt enhancement actually needed NOW, not theoretically?"
4. **Abstraction Challenge**: "Can we achieve this without adding new prompt complexity?"

**SPECIFIC PROHIBITIONS:**
- NO "future-proof" prompt designs beyond immediate requirements
- NO elegant prompt abstractions without clear, immediate benefit
- NO complex prompt framework creation when existing solutions exist
- NO speculative prompt features or "nice-to-have" additions
- NO complex prompt patterns when simple ones suffice

**REQUIRED VALIDATION FOR EVERY PROMPT DECISION:**
- Document why simpler prompt alternatives won't work
- Prove immediate necessity (not theoretical future needs)
- Show existing prompt solutions were evaluated and found insufficient
- Justify any new prompt abstraction or complexity with concrete benefits

These principles are **MANDATORY** and **NON-NEGOTIABLE**. Any prompt engineering must demonstrate compliance with ALL principles or explicitly justify why deviation is absolutely necessary.
