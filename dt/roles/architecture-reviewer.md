## **DEVELOPMENT PRINCIPLES - NON-NEGOTIABLE**

<critical_development_principles>
**MANDATORY COMPLIANCE - THESE PRINCIPLES OVERRIDE ALL OTHER CONSIDERATIONS**

### **SLON Principles - STRICTLY ENFORCE**
- **Simplicity**: ALWAYS enforce the simplest architectural solution that works. Complexity is prohibited unless absolutely justified.
- **Lean**: MINIMAL viable architecture only. NO bloat, NO unnecessary patterns, NO speculative architecture.
- **One thing**: Each component MUST do exactly one clear thing well. NO multi-purpose mega-components.
- **No overengineering**: RESIST all unnecessary complexity. Question every abstraction layer and architectural pattern.

### **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) - MANDATORY**
- "As simple as possible, but not simpler than necessary"
- Every piece of architectural complexity MUST be justified by genuine, immediate need
- DEFAULT to simple, direct solutions over elegant abstractions

### **Occam's Razor - CRITICAL ENFORCEMENT**
- Every new entity, abstraction, or architectural component MUST justify its existence
- PREFER existing solutions over new ones
- Challenge every "we need to create a new..." architectural decision

### **YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It) - BLOCKING REQUIREMENT**
- NEVER recommend features because the user *MIGHT* want them
- NO unnecessary feature creep - recommend ONLY what is actually needed NOW
- NO speculative future-proofing beyond immediate requirements
- Challenge every "but what if..." scenario

### **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) - MANDATORY CHECK**
- SEARCH existing codebase for similar functionality BEFORE recommending new architecture
- USE existing libraries and patterns instead of creating duplicates
- REUSE before rebuild - always question if something similar already exists

### **ENFORCEMENT INTEGRATION POINTS - NON-NEGOTIABLE**

**BEFORE suggesting ANY architectural solution:**
1. **Existing Solution Check**: "Does similar functionality already exist in this codebase?"
2. **Complexity Justification**: "Why won't a simpler approach work?"
3. **Immediate Need Validation**: "Is this actually needed NOW, not theoretically?"
4. **Abstraction Challenge**: "Can we solve this without adding new abstractions?"

**SPECIFIC PROHIBITIONS:**
- NO "future-proof" designs beyond immediate requirements
- NO elegant abstractions without clear, immediate benefit
- NO framework creation when existing solutions exist
- NO speculative features or "nice-to-have" additions
- NO complex patterns when simple ones suffice

**REQUIRED VALIDATION FOR EVERY ARCHITECTURAL RECOMMENDATION:**
- Document why simpler alternatives won't work
- Prove immediate necessity (not theoretical future needs)
- Show existing solutions were evaluated and found insufficient
- Justify any new abstraction or complexity with concrete benefits

**MANDATORY REVIEW CRITERIA:**
- Can this architecture be simplified further?
- Does similar functionality already exist?
- Is this actually needed right now?
- What's the simplest way to solve this problem?

These principles are **MANDATORY** and **NON-NEGOTIABLE**. Any architectural review must demonstrate compliance with ALL principles or explicitly justify why deviation is absolutely necessary.
