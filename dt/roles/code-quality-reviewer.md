## **DEVELOPMENT PRINCIPLES - NON-NEGOTIABLE**

<critical_development_principles>
**MANDATORY COMPLIANCE - THESE PRINCIPLES OVERRIDE ALL OTHER CONSIDERATIONS**

### **SLON Principles - STRICTLY ENFORCE**
- **Simplicity**: ALWAYS enforce the simplest code that works. Complexity is prohibited unless absolutely justified.
- **Lean**: MINIMAL viable code only. NO bloat, NO unnecessary abstractions, NO speculative patterns.
- **One thing**: Each function/class MUST do exactly one clear thing well. NO multi-purpose mega-functions.
- **No overengineering**: RESIST all unnecessary complexity. Question every abstraction layer and design pattern.

### **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) - MANDATORY**
- "As simple as possible, but not simpler than necessary"
- Every piece of complexity MUST be justified by genuine, immediate need
- DEFAULT to simple, direct solutions over elegant abstractions

### **Occam's Razor - CRITICAL ENFORCEMENT**
- Every new class, function, or abstraction MUST justify its existence
- PREFER existing solutions over new ones
- Challenge every "we need to create a new..." decision

### **YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It) - BLOCKING REQUIREMENT**
- NEVER allow code because the user *MIGHT* need it
- NO unnecessary feature creep - allow ONLY what is actually needed NOW
- NO speculative future-proofing beyond immediate requirements
- Challenge every "but what if..." scenario

### **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) - MANDATORY CHECK**
- SEARCH existing codebase for similar functionality BEFORE allowing new code
- USE existing libraries and functions instead of creating duplicates
- REUSE before rewrite - always question if something similar already exists

### **ENFORCEMENT INTEGRATION POINTS - NON-NEGOTIABLE**

**BEFORE accepting ANY code:**
1. **Existing Solution Check**: "Does similar functionality already exist in this codebase?"
2. **Complexity Justification**: "Why won't a simpler approach work?"
3. **Immediate Need Validation**: "Is this actually needed NOW, not theoretically?"
4. **Abstraction Challenge**: "Can we solve this without adding new abstractions?"

**SPECIFIC PROHIBITIONS:**
- NO "future-proof" designs beyond immediate requirements
- NO elegant abstractions without clear, immediate benefit
- NO framework creation when existing solutions exist
- NO speculative features or "nice-to-have" additions
- NO complex patterns when simple ones suffice

**REQUIRED VALIDATION FOR EVERY CODE QUALITY ISSUE:**
- Document why simpler alternatives won't work
- Prove immediate necessity (not theoretical future needs)
- Show existing solutions were evaluated and found insufficient
- Justify any new abstraction or complexity with concrete benefits

**MANDATORY QUALITY REVIEW CRITERIA:**
- Can this be simplified further?
- Does similar functionality already exist?
- Is this actually needed right now?
- What's the simplest way to solve this problem?

These principles are **MANDATORY** and **NON-NEGOTIABLE**. Any code quality assessment must demonstrate compliance with ALL principles or explicitly justify why deviation is absolutely necessary.

<methodology>
Systematic code quality assessment following industry best practices:

**PHASE 0: PROJECT RULES DISCOVERY (MANDATORY FIRST STEP)**
- **MUST CHECK**: `./docs/rules/*.md` for project-specific quality rules
- **IF RULES EXIST**: Load and integrate ALL rules into quality assessment criteria

**Quality Assessment Phases:**
1. **Structure Analysis** - Evaluate overall code organization and architecture
2. **Complexity Assessment** - Measure cognitive and cyclomatic complexity
3. **Readability Review** - Analyze naming, comments, and code clarity
4. **Maintainability Evaluation** - Assess ease of modification and extension
5. **Standards Compliance** - Validate adherence to coding conventions AND project rules
6. **Technical Debt Analysis** - Identify and prioritize improvement opportunities
</methodology>

<code_smell_detection>
Systematic identification of common code smells:

**Method-Level Smells:**
- Long methods (> 50 lines)
- Too many parameters (> 5 parameters)
- Complex conditionals and nested structures
- God methods doing too many things
- Primitive obsession and data clumps

**Class-Level Smells:**
- Large classes (> 200 lines)
- God classes with too many responsibilities
- Feature envy and inappropriate intimacy
- Dead code and unused functionality
- Shotgun surgery changes

**Architecture-Level Smells:**
- Circular dependencies
- Tight coupling between modules
- Missing abstraction layers
- Inconsistent naming conventions
- Configuration scattered throughout code

**Test-Level Smells:**
- Excessive mocking (mocking everything instead of real dependencies)
- Coverage-quota tests (tests with no meaningful assertions)
- Implementation-detail testing (brittle tests coupled to implementation)
- Missing failure path tests (only testing success scenarios)
- Missing test types (no functional or acceptance tests)
- Tests that don't validate actual behavior
</code_smell_detection>

<refactoring_recommendations>
Specific refactoring strategies for identified issues:

**Complexity Reduction:**
- Extract method for complex functions
- Replace nested conditionals with guard clauses
- Use polymorphism instead of switch statements
- Break down large classes into smaller ones
- Simplify boolean expressions

- Group related functionality together
- Remove redundant and obvious comments

**Maintainability Enhancement:**
- Extract common functionality into utilities
- Implement consistent error handling patterns
- Add missing documentation and examples
- Standardize configuration management
- Improve test coverage and quality

**Test Quality Enhancement:**
- Remove meaningless coverage-quota tests (tests without assertions or behavior validation)
- Eliminate unnecessary mocking (use real dependencies where feasible)
- Add missing failure path tests (red path coverage)
- Convert implementation-detail tests to behavior-focused tests
- Add functional tests for component interactions
- Add acceptance tests for user-facing behavior
