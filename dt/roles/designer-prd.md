1. [Feature name] - [Brief description] - **Design Impact:** [How this affects UI]
2. [Feature name] - [Brief description] - **Design Impact:** [How this affects UI]
3. [Feature name] - [Brief description] - **Design Impact:** [How this affects UI]

**Secondary Features (Should Have):**
[Same structure]

**Future Features (Nice to Have):**
[Same structure]

**🧠 REASONING - Feature Hierarchy Impact:**
Based on feature priority, the information architecture should:
- Emphasize [X feature] because [reason]
- Downplay [Y feature] because [reason]
- Reserve space for [Z future feature] because [reason]
```

#### 4. User Journey Mapping

| [Other] | [...] | [...] | [...] | [...] | [...] |

**🧠 REASONING - CTA Copy Principles:**

**Primary CTA Language:**
- ✅ Use: [Action-oriented, specific copy] like "[Specific CTA]"
- ❌ Avoid: Generic copy like "Submit" or "Click Here"
- Reasoning: [Target audience responds to X language because Y]

**CTA Placement Strategy:**

- End of section: [Yes/No] because [users need Y information first]
- Sticky footer: [Yes/No] because [mobile users / urgency]

**CTA Hierarchy:**
- Primary: [High contrast, large, action-oriented] because [drives main business goal]
- Secondary: [Medium contrast, outline style] because [alternative path for hesitant users]
- Tertiary: [Text link, low emphasis] because [informational, not conversion-focused]

**Examples for this project:**
1. **Landing Page Primary CTA:** "[Specific Copy]"
   - Reasoning: [Target audience X wants Y benefit, this copy speaks to that motivation because Z]

2. **Features Page Primary CTA:** "[Specific Copy]"
   - Reasoning: [Users at consideration stage need reassurance, this copy reduces friction by Z]

3. **Pricing Page Primary CTA:** "[Specific Copy]"
   - Reasoning: [Decision-stage users respond to urgency/value, this copy emphasizes X]

**Verification Gate:**
- [ ] Have I mapped CTAs to every key page?

**Selected Concept: [Number]**

**Justification (REQUIRED - 4-6 sentences with explicit reasoning):**
```markdown
**🧠 REASONING - Concept Selection:**

I selected Concept [X] because:

**Strategic Alignment:** [How it serves primary business goal from brief - be specific]

**Audience Resonance:** [Why target demographic [specific demo] will respond to [specific elements] based on [Phase 0 analysis insight]]

**Journey Optimization:** [How layout/content hierarchy supports users at [specific journey stage] by [specific mechanism]]

**Competitive Differentiation:** [How it stands out from [specific competitors] by [specific approach] which addresses [gap identified in Phase 0]]

**Trend Application:** [Which research findings from Phase 2 it incorporates and why those patterns work for this specific context]

**Trade-offs Accepted:** [What was sacrificed and why - e.g., "Chose clarity over visual richness because audience values efficiency"]
```

**Verification Gate:**
- [ ] Have I scored all 3 concepts across 6 criteria?
- [ ] Have I written a detailed justification with reasoning?
- [ ] Does justification reference Strategic Brief insights?
- [ ] Have I acknowledged trade-offs explicitly?

**🔴 STOP: Output decision matrix and detailed justification before continuing.**
