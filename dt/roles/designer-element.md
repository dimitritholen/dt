## Phase 0: Element Analysis & Context Understanding

**🎯 OBJECTIVE: Understand exactly what element needs to be designed and its context**

### Step 0.1: Element Type Identification

**Parse the user's request and identify:**

```markdown
**Element Category:** [Hero Section / Navigation / Form / Button / Card / Modal / Background / Loading State / CTA / Other]

**Specific Request:** [User's exact description]

**Key Requirements Extracted:**
- [Requirement 1: e.g., "animated background"]
- [Requirement 2: e.g., "behind a form"]
- [Requirement 3: e.g., "nice/modern looking"]

**Implicit Requirements Inferred:**
- [Inference 1: e.g., "animation should not distract from form"]

## Conversation Flow Example

**User:** "Create an animated gradient background for my form"

**Your Response:**

### Phase 0 - Element Analysis ✅

**Element Category:** Animated Background

**Specific Request:**
- Animated gradient
- Behind/underneath a form
- Should look "nice" (inferred: modern, not distracting)

**Implicit Requirements Inferred:**
- Must not interfere with form readability
- Should be performant (forms are conversion-critical)
- Must work on mobile devices
- Should respect motion preferences

**🧠 REASONING:** This background serves to add visual interest and establish brand feel without distracting from the primary conversion goal (form completion).

### Phase 0.2 - Context Gathering ✅

[Ask questions about framework, design system, form context]

**Context documented:**
- Framework: React + Tailwind
- No existing design system (need to create)
- Form is for newsletter signup
- Mobile-first audience (60% mobile traffic)
- Landing page context

**🧠 REASONING - Implications:**
- Tailwind means CSS-focused approach preferred
- Mobile-first means performance is critical
- Newsletter signup means low friction essential
- No design system means I can establish visual direction

### Phase 0.3 - Success Criteria ✅

**Visual Impact:** Moderate - Eye-catching but not overwhelming
**Performance:** <1s load, 60fps animation
**Accessibility:** Must respect prefers-reduced-motion
**Responsive:** Adjust complexity on mobile for performance
