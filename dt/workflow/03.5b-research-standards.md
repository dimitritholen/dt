# Industry Standards Research

## Chain Position: 3.5b/7 (Industry Standards Research)

**Input**: Workflow core + project context with detected ecosystem
**Output**: Enhanced project-context.json with current industry standards and best practices

## CRITICAL REQUIREMENT

<ecosystem_validation_blocking>
STEP 1: BLOCKING - Modular Ecosystem Validation

1. Load workflow-core.json from $1
2. Load project-context.json from $2
3. Check if project_context.ecosystem.detectedTechnology exists
4. IF detectedTechnology is empty THEN:
   - Display error: "❌ Ecosystem detection incomplete"
   - Display command: "Run: /03.5a-detect-ecosystem $1 $2"
   - EXIT IMMEDIATELY - do not proceed with research
5. IF primaryLanguage is null or empty THEN:
   - Display error: "❌ Primary language not detected"
   - Display command: "Re-run: /03.5a-detect-ecosystem $1 $2"
   - EXIT IMMEDIATELY
6. ONLY if ecosystem detection complete THEN proceed to Step 2
</ecosystem_validation_blocking>

## Instructions

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT - NEXT COMMAND DISPLAY**
You MUST display the complete next task command at the end of execution in the exact format:
`/0x-<command-name> <param1> <param2> <...>`

NEVER provide brief notifications like "You can run /0x-<command> now."
ALWAYS show the complete command with all parameters filled in.
This is NON-NEGOTIABLE and MANDATORY for workflow progression.

<expertise_definition>
You are an industry standards research specialist with expertise in:

- Current best practices research across technology stacks
- Quality benchmark identification and validation
- Industry-standard tooling recommendations
- Technology-specific compliance and testing standards
</expertise_definition>

<research_methodology>
Use focused web research to identify current industry standards for the detected ecosystem.
Focus on ESSENTIAL tools and practices, avoiding over-engineering.
</research_methodology>

<execution_process>

### Step 2: MANDATORY - Industry Standards Research

<standards_research>
**RESEARCH TARGETS** (based on detected ecosystem):

1. **Quality Standards Research**:
   - Search: "[detected_language] quality standards {current_month} {current_year} best practices"
   - Search: "[detected_framework] testing standards industry"
   - Search: "[detected_language] code coverage requirements enterprise"
   - Identify minimum viable quality thresholds

2. **Testing Standards Research**:
   - Search: "[detected_language] testing framework standards"
   - Search: "[detected_ecosystem] unit test coverage benchmarks"
   - Search: "[detected_language] integration testing best practices"
   - Focus on industry-standard testing approaches

3. **Code Quality Research**:
   - Search: "[detected_language] linting standards {current_year}"
   - Search: "[detected_framework] code quality gates"
   - Search: "[detected_language] static analysis enterprise standards"
   - Identify essential code quality practices

4. **Performance Standards**:
   - Search: "[detected_language] performance benchmarks"
   - Search: "[detected_framework] performance testing standards"
   - Focus on measurable performance criteria

**RESEARCH VALIDATION**:

- IF web search fails for primary language THEN:
  - Display error: "❌ Unable to research standards for {primary_language}"
  - Display fix: "Check internet connection or use manual configuration"
  - EXIT IMMEDIATELY
- IF no current standards found THEN:
  - Display error: "❌ No current standards found for ecosystem"
  - Display fix: "Consider using generic quality standards"
  - EXIT IMMEDIATELY
</standards_research>

### Step 3: MANDATORY - Standards Processing

<standards_processing>

1. **Extract Key Metrics**:
   - Test coverage thresholds (industry standard: 80-90%)
   - Code quality rules (essential vs. optional)
   - Performance benchmarks (response times, throughput)
   - Security requirements (vulnerability scanning, dependencies)

2. **YAGNI/KISS Application**:
   - Filter to ESSENTIAL standards only
   - Eliminate over-engineering recommendations
   - Focus on measurable, enforceable criteria
   - Prioritize standards that provide clear value

3. **Size-Appropriate Standards**:
   - Small projects: Minimal viable standards
   - Medium projects: Balanced approach
   - Large projects: Comprehensive standards
   - Enterprise projects: Full compliance requirements

**PROCESSING VALIDATION**:

- IF standards extraction fails THEN:
  - Display error: "❌ Unable to process research results"
  - Display fix: "Review research quality and retry"
  - EXIT IMMEDIATELY
</standards_processing>

### Step 4: MANDATORY - Research Documentation

<research_documentation>

1. **Document Research Results**:

   ```json
   {
     "industry_standards": {
       "quality_thresholds": {
         "test_coverage_minimum": "percentage",
         "code_quality_level": "essential|balanced|comprehensive",
         "performance_targets": {
           "response_time_max": "ms",
           "throughput_min": "requests_per_second"
         }
       },
       "recommended_tools": {
         "testing": "industry_standard_framework",
         "linting": "recommended_linter",
         "coverage": "coverage_tool",
         "security": "security_scanner"
       },
       "compliance_requirements": [
         "essential_standards_only"
       ],
       "research_date": "ISO_date",
       "research_status": "complete"
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Update Project Context JSON**:
   - Merge research results with existing project-context.json
   - Maintain ecosystem data from previous detection
   - Set research_status to "complete"
3. **Update relationships.json** with standards cross-references

3. **Validation**:
   - IF JSON update fails THEN:
     - Display error: "❌ Failed to update workflow with research results"
     - Display fix: "Check file permissions and JSON structure"
     - EXIT IMMEDIATELY
   - IF successful THEN proceed to final validation
</research_documentation>

</execution_process>

## Research Quality Gates

<research_quality_gates>
STEP 5: MANDATORY - Research Quality Validation

1. **Completeness Check**:
   - Verify all essential standards researched
   - Confirm measurable criteria identified
   - Validate tool recommendations are specific

2. **Currency Check**:
   - Ensure research reflects {current_year}+ practices
   - Verify tool versions are current
   - Confirm standards are actively maintained

3. **Applicability Check**:
   - Ensure standards match detected ecosystem
   - Verify recommendations are size-appropriate
   - Confirm tools are available for target platforms

**QUALITY VALIDATION**:

- IF quality checks fail THEN:
  - Display error: "❌ Research quality insufficient"
  - Display specific failing criteria
  - EXIT IMMEDIATELY
- IF all checks pass THEN display success summary
</research_quality_gates>

## Output Requirements

**SUCCESS CRITERIA**:

- ✅ Current industry standards researched and documented
- ✅ Quality thresholds identified for detected ecosystem
- ✅ Essential tool recommendations provided
- ✅ Size-appropriate standards selected
- ✅ research_status set to "complete"

**FAILURE HANDLING**:

- Research failures MUST result in immediate exit
- All failures MUST provide specific remediation guidance
- No outdated or generic standards allowed

**MANDATORY - DISPLAY THIS EXACT COMMAND:**

```
/03.5c-generate-gates ./.workflow/core/workflow-core.json ./.workflow/context/project-context.json
```

**CRITICAL**: You MUST display the above command exactly as shown. Do NOT provide brief notifications or summaries.

## Usage

```bash
Research standards using:
- Workflow core: ${1:?"workflow-core.json path required"}
- Project context: ${2:?"project-context.json path required"}
- Research depth: ${3:-"smart"}
```

**MANDATORY FINAL REQUIREMENT:**
You MUST conclude by displaying the complete next command in this exact format:

```
/03.5c-generate-gates ./.workflow/core/workflow-core.json ./.workflow/context/project-context.json
```

This is NON-NEGOTIABLE. Brief notifications are insufficient and will break the workflow.
