## Chain Position: 7/7 (Pull Request Creation & Delivery)

**Input**: Quality-validated modular workflow files with completed implementation
**Output**: Atomic pull request with comprehensive documentation and metadata

## Instructions

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT - NEXT COMMAND DISPLAY**
You MUST display the complete next task command at the end of execution in the exact format:
`/0x-<command-name> <param1> <param2> <...>`

NEVER provide brief notifications like "You can run /0x-<command> now."
ALWAYS show the complete command with all parameters filled in.
This is NON-NEGOTIABLE and MANDATORY for workflow progression.

</chain_of_draft_methodology>

<atomic_pr_principles>
Ensure PR follows atomic principles:

1. **Single Responsibility**: PR addresses one specific change or feature
2. **Self-Contained**: PR can be understood and reviewed independently
3. **Minimal Scope**: Smallest possible change that delivers value
4. **Quality Complete**: All tests pass, coverage maintained, documentation updated
5. **Reviewable**: Changes are logical, well-documented, and easy to understand
6. **Deployable**: PR can be safely merged and deployed independently
</atomic_pr_principles>

<enterprise_pr_standards>
Apply enterprise PR standards:

**Commit Message Standards:**

- Follow conventional commit format
- Include ticket/issue references
- Provide clear, actionable descriptions
- Maintain consistency with project conventions

**PR Description Standards:**

- Comprehensive summary of changes and rationale
- Clear testing and validation evidence
- Impact analysis and risk assessment
- Deployment and rollback procedures

**Review Process Standards:**

- Appropriate reviewer selection and assignment
- Clear acceptance criteria and checklist
- Documentation of architectural decisions
- Performance and security impact analysis
</enterprise_pr_standards>

<quality_validation_integration>
Before PR creation, validate all enterprise quality gates:

- ‚úì All tests passing (100% success rate)
- ‚úì Code coverage above 85% threshold
- ‚úì Zero linting or style violations
- ‚úì Security scans show no high-severity issues
- ‚úì Performance benchmarks within acceptable limits
- ‚úì Documentation is complete and accurate
</quality_validation_integration>

## Execution Process

<fail_fast_implementation>
STEP 1: MANDATORY - Modular Quality Validation Prerequisites

1. Load workflow-core.json from $1
2. IF file does not exist THEN:
   - Display error: "‚ùå Workflow core file missing"
   - Display fix: "Run previous workflow commands first"
   - EXIT IMMEDIATELY
3. Load implementation.json from ./.workflow/implementation/implementation.json
4. IF implementation file does not exist or tasks array is empty THEN:
   - Display error: "‚ùå No completed implementation tasks found"
   - Display fix: "Run: /dt:workflow:04-generate-code to implement features"
   - EXIT IMMEDIATELY
5. Load testing.json from ./.workflow/testing/testing.json
6. IF testing.results.overall_status != "PASSED" THEN:
   - Display error: "‚ùå Quality validation incomplete or failed"
   - Display fix: "Run: /dt:workflow:06-assure-quality until all gates pass"
   - EXIT IMMEDIATELY
7. ONLY if all prerequisites met THEN proceed to Step 2
</fail_fast_implementation>

## PR Creation Process

<cross_platform_pr_efficiency>
**CROSS-PLATFORM TOKEN EFFICIENCY FOR PR CREATION**

**Universal jq patterns (work on Bash, PowerShell, CMD):**

```bash
# Get completed task summaries from implementation.json (< 200 tokens)
jq '.tasks.atomicTasks[] | select(.status == "completed") | {id, description, type}' ./.workflow/implementation/implementation.json

# Extract quality metrics from testing.json (< 100 tokens)
jq '.results // {}' ./.workflow/testing/testing.json

# Get project metadata from workflow-core.json (< 50 tokens)
jq '{name: .project.name, type: .project.type, description: .project.description}' ./.workflow/core/workflow-core.json

# Extract AI agent review results from testing.json (< 300 tokens)
jq '.agent_reviews // {}' ./.workflow/testing/testing.json
```

**Platform-specific assignment examples:**

- **Bash/zsh:** `COMPLETED_TASKS=$(jq '.tasks.atomicTasks[] | select(.status == "completed")' ./.workflow/implementation/implementation.json)`
- **PowerShell:** `$COMPLETED_TASKS = jq '.tasks.atomicTasks[] | select(.status == "completed")' ./.workflow/implementation/implementation.json`
- **CMD:** `jq ".tasks.atomicTasks[] | select(.status == \"completed\")" ./.workflow/implementation/implementation.json > completed.json`

**Token efficiency:** Extract only PR-relevant data (< 500 tokens) vs entire workflow JSON
</cross_platform_pr_efficiency>

### Step 1: Extract PR Context and Analyze Changes

**Cross-platform approach - use appropriate variable assignment for your shell:**

```bash
# 1. Get project metadata for PR context (< 100 tokens)
jq '{name: .project_name // "unknown", type: .project_type // "unknown", description: .project_description // "", size: .project_size // "medium"}' "$WORKFLOW_FILE"

# 2. Get completed tasks summary (< 200 tokens)
jq '[.tasks[] | select(.status == "completed") | {id, description, type, quality_passed: (.quality_gates.success_criteria.all_tests_pass // false)}]' "$WORKFLOW_FILE"

# 3. Extract quality metrics for PR evidence (< 100 tokens)
jq '.quality_metrics // {}' "$WORKFLOW_FILE"

# 4. Get AI agent review results (< 300 tokens)
jq '.ai_agent_reviews // {}' "$WORKFLOW_FILE"

# 5. Get deployment readiness status (< 50 tokens)
jq '.deployment_readiness // "pending"' "$WORKFLOW_FILE"

echo "üìã Cross-platform PR context extraction complete - <750 tokens total"

# Use platform-appropriate assignment: $() for Bash, direct for PowerShell, temp files for CMD
# Analyze: completed tasks, quality compliance, AI reviews, deployment readiness
```

### Step 2: Git Status and Preparation

```
Execute Git analysis:
- Check current branch status

jq --arg pr_url "$PR_URL" \
   --argjson completion_metrics "$COMPLETION_METRICS" \
   --arg completion_date "$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)" \
   '.pull_request = {url: $pr_url, created_at: $completion_date} |
    .completion_metrics = $completion_metrics |
    .status = "completed" |
    .completed_at = $completion_date' \
   "$WORKFLOW_FILE" > final-workflow.json
```

## Workflow Completion Analysis

**MANDATORY**: Analyze workflow completion status and any remaining tasks:

1. Load and analyze ./.workflow/core/workflow-core.json for complete workflow status
2. Load and analyze ./.workflow/implementation/implementation.json for all task completion
3. Load and analyze ./.workflow/testing/testing.json for comprehensive quality validation
4. Verify PR creation success and deployment readiness

**CHAIN OF THOUGHTS ANALYSIS**:

1. Check if ALL development tasks in implementation.json have status = "completed"
2. Check if ALL quality gates in testing.json have status = "PASSED"
3. Check if PR was successfully created and is ready for review
4. Identify any remaining workflow tasks or follow-up actions
5. Based on analysis, display completion status and any remaining commands

## Workflow Status Report

**MANDATORY**: Display comprehensive workflow completion status with any remaining actions.

**CRITICAL ENFORCEMENT**: You MUST display the complete command format with all parameters filled in if any tasks remain. Brief notifications like "You can run /command now" are STRICTLY FORBIDDEN.

**WORKFLOW COMPLETION STATUS:**

**‚úÖ SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED:**

- PR Created: [PR-URL]
- All Development Tasks: [COMPLETED-COUNT]/[TOTAL-COUNT]
- Quality Gates Status: [PASSED/FAILED]
- Test Coverage: [COVERAGE-PERCENTAGE]%
- Security Validation: [PASSED/FAILED]
- Performance Validation: [PASSED/FAILED]

**REMAINING ACTIONS (if any):**

**IF any development tasks remain incomplete:**

```
/dt:workflow:04-generate-code ./.workflow/core/workflow-core.json ./.workflow/implementation/implementation.json [remaining-task-id]
```

**IF any quality gates failed:**

```
/dt:workflow:06-assure-quality ./.workflow/core/workflow-core.json ./.workflow/testing/testing.json fix-mode
```

**IF all complete - Next Steps:**

- **PR Review**: Share PR with team for code review
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Monitor automated build and test execution
- **Deployment**: Prepare for deployment after PR approval
- **Monitoring**: Set up post-deployment monitoring and validation

**COMPLETION SUMMARY:**

- Provide PR URL and tracking information
- Summarize quality achievements and compliance
- Document any follow-up actions required
- Celebrate successful enterprise delivery!

**REQUIRED OUTPUT**: You MUST analyze the complete workflow state and display actual completion status with specific metrics. If anything remains incomplete, show the exact commands needed to finish the workflow.

**FINAL CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: If any workflow tasks remain incomplete, you MUST conclude your response by displaying the complete next command with ALL parameters specified. Use this exact format:

```
/dt:workflow:0x-<command-name> <complete-parameters>
```

Do NOT use placeholder text like [task-id]. Use ACTUAL values from the workflow files.
This requirement is NON-NEGOTIABLE and essential for workflow continuity.

**Command Execution:**

Create PR using:

- Workflow core: ${1:?"workflow-core.json path required"}
- PR template: ${2:-"enterprise-standard"}
- Branch name: ${3:-"auto-generate"}

Use Chain of Draft methodology to create enterprise-grade atomic pull request with comprehensive documentation, quality evidence, and optimized reviewer experience.
